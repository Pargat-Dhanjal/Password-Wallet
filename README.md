# Encrypt-It

Encrypt-It is a modern, secure, and open-source password manager that stores and manages your most sensitive information. You can run Encrypt-It on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Encrypt-It is for users who tend to forget their passwords and want to lock their passwords behind a master password.

The passwords are stored locally on your machine and that too in an encrypted format. We have used a secure Fernet Key (symmetric encryption) for encrypting all your passwords. The user gets to store the safe key which is a URL-safe base64-encoded 32-byte key anywhere which along with your master password is responsible for encrypting your passwords.
